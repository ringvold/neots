# neots (NeoOTS)

Inspired by https://github.com/sniptt-official/ots but but implements 
ChaCha20-Poly1305 (ChaPoly) instead of AES GCM.

Backend supporting ChaPoly and AES GCM: https://github.com/ringvold/ots

**TODO:**
- [ ] Actually support expires flag (expiry is hard coded to 2 hours)

## Why ChaPoly?
Some people seems to prefer ChaCha20-Poly1305 (ChaPoly for short) over AES 
GCM. It does not require hardware acceleration to be fast. It might be a bit 
more secure, theoretically, maybe, but what do I know, I'm no expert. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
